Freelance Client
=================

WordPress plugin for freelance client sites

You're a web professional that works with multiple clients. What do you wish
you had? I had a couple of ideas, and implemented them in this plugin. You
probably wish for a way to prevent clients from changing things about the way
you've set up the site.  Perhaps you need a way to communicate your contact
information the users of the site.

## Current Features

* An editable dashboard widget for your contact info
* A new role - Site Administrator - with some of the more dangerous aspects
  disabled
* The wordpress update nag is disabled for all non-Administrators, so clients
  don't worry about it.

I'd love to hear your thoughts/needs are.

## In Progress

* Ability to receive messages from your website developer's [freelance-manager](https://www.github.com/andrewwoods/freelance-manager) plugin
